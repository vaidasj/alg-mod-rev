 User did not provide appropriate variable bounds. 
 Some model expressions are unbounded.             
 We may not be able to guarantee globality.        
 Number of missing variable or expression bounds =     14
 Number of variable or expression bounds autoset =     14

  (Note that BARON uses a different formula to compute the relative gap as
   was used for the above reported value.)
