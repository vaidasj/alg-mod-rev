Packing identical size circles in the unit circle (CPACK,SEQ=387)
C o m p i l a t i o n


      Given the unit circle (of radius 1), find a set of identical
      size circles with an optimized (maximal) radius r so that all
      such circles are contained by the unit circle, in a non-overlapping
      arrangement.
