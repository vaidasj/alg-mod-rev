      The problem consists of determining the product mix for a furniture shop with two
      workstations: carpentry and finishing. The availability of labor in man-hours at
      the two stations is limited. There are four product classes, each consuming a
      certain number of man-hours at the two stations. Each product earns a certain
      profit and the shop has the option to purchase labor from outside. The objective
      is to maximize the profit.
