      This example outlines procedures for implementing various serial and
      parallel iterative schemes. For simplicity, a system of linear equations
      is selected. This schema extends naturally to other problem types like
      nonlinear systems and mixed complementarity problems.
       
      We will implement various ways to solve the problem:
